# fitness_application
My first code sample is a java-based workout tracker application that I programmed in high school. The program runs through a central GUI and can 
be started by running IA1.java file. I included a more thorough breakdown of my methodology/processes/progress in the documentation folder.
A link to a video walkthorugh of the code is included there as well (Crit_D_functionality.mp4 â€” the file size is too large to be included in the README).
